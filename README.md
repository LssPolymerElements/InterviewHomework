## Requirements: ##

 - Single page application. 
 - Responsive mobile / desktop design. 
 - Use [Polymer Material Elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/author/PolymerElements) for this assignment such as:
     - [paper-input](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-input)
     - [paper-button](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-button)
 -  Page should closely follow [mockup](https://app.moqups.com/aaron@aarondrabeck.com/rekW1P2jz8/view).  
	 - [Page 1 (see mock-up)](https://app.moqups.com/aaron@aarondrabeck.com/rekW1P2jz8/view/page/a2b41c7ff)
	     - Has calculator with two states (calculator & results)
	     - Performs calculation based on paper-input values and then switches to the result state. 
	     - Uses this formula to calculate the amount saved: employees * (modification percent/100) * 150
	     - Shows amount saved as a dollar amount on the results state
	     - The recalculate button on the results state should do these things when clicked:
	         - a. Switch from results to the calculator state.
	         - b. Resets the paper-input's values to 0.
	 - [Page 2 (see-mockup)](https://app.moqups.com/aaron@aarondrabeck.com/rekW1P2jz8/view/page/a1a4f1538)
	     - Has calculator with the same functionality as Page 1 that should now be
   located at the top of the page. 
	     - The amount saved from the calculator on this page should additionally be shown in the bottom text.
	 - [Page 3 (see-mockup)](https://app.moqups.com/aaron@aarondrabeck.com/rekW1P2jz8/view/page/a9a81d7d8) 
	     - This page should contain a simple list of the amounts saved from anytime a calculator on page one or page two is used.
	     - On Initial Load this list should be empty.  After one calculator submit it should have one amount saved. After two calculator submits it should have two items in the list and so on.
	     - This page should also recalculate and display the standard deviation of the amounts saved in the list whenever an item is added.
   	     - Do not worry about persisting data on page reload.
